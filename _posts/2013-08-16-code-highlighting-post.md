I find it hilarious that I am actually doing this crap, but if you ever wanted to know how to render a svg generated by d3 into a downloadable pdf, png, whatever, here is one solution.  This is all based on the work done [here](http://d3export.housegordon.org).  I couldn't use the perl script on the server side because I'm using [Tangelo](http://tangelo.kitware.com) to develop prototype web applications.  At first, I thought I'd just call the perl script through subprocess or pyperl, but that was mainly because I didn't want to spend anytime understanding what the perl script actually did.


### Pygments Code Blocks

To modify styling and highlight colors edit `/assets/less/pygments.less` and compile `main.less` with your favorite preprocessor. Or edit `main.css` if that's your thing, the classes you want to modify all begin with `.highlight`.
