## On the structure of scientific revolutions

In 2004, I attended a talk by Stephen Smale on the mathematical foundations of learning.  Previously, I hadn't been exposed to what is now called machine learning.   During my graduate studies, I started applying machine learning methods to time series forecasting and algorithmic game theory.  I was using recurrent neural networks for forecasting back in 2007!  I was blown away by the research of Alan Kirman.  He showed how market structure emerged from individual behavior which did not resemble the macrodynamics at all (i.e. upward sloping demand curves).   Learning and emergence became the themes of my dissertation.  What kinds of social structures emerge when people learn from their past interactions?

## Hebbian Learning

Donald Hebb wrote in 1949:

> When an axon in cell A is near enough to excite cell N and repeatedly and persistently takes part in firing it, some 
> growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficient in firing B is increased.
